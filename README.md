1. This is the backend that does returns CSP headers. And this has no inline javascript & no event attached with any access button. The access button with the needed JS, to access the iframe DOM, would be injected on demand by the BullyGiant app.  It also has iframe sandbox resrtrictions imposed. It does not return the X-XSS-Protection header set to 0 either
2. To run the backend, please update the IP, in the main.py,  with your own IP
